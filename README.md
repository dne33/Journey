## Importing project from VCS (Using IntelliJ)
IntelliJ has built-in support for importing projects directly from Version Control Systems (VCS) like GitLab.
To download and import your project:

- Launch IntelliJ and chose `Get from VCS` from the start-up window.
- Input the url of your project e.g. `https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/seng202-2022/team-X`.

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Maven pop up doesn't appear then open the Maven sidebar and click the Refresh icon labeled 'Reimport All Maven Projects'.*


## Importing Project from a folder (Using IntelliJ)
IntelliJ has built-in support for Maven (although if you turned the Maven plugin off when you were setting it up
youâ€™ll need to re-enable it). To import your project:

- Launch IntelliJ and choose `Open` from the start-up window.
- Select the project folder.
- Select `Import project from external model` and make sure that `Maven is highlighted.

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Maven pop up doesn't appear then open the Maven sidebar and click the Refresh icon labeled 'Reimport All Maven Projects'.*
